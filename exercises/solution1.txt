4. byte z = (byte)100L;
a) 1 and 2
b) 2 and 3
c) 3 and 4
d) All statements are correct
View Answer
Answer: d
Explanation: Statements (1), (2), (3), and (4) are correct. (1) is correct because when a floating-point number (a double in this case) is cast to an int, it simply loses the digits after the decimal. (2) and (4) are correct because a long can be cast into a byte. If the long is over 127, it loses its most significant (leftmost) bits. (3) actually works, even though a cast is not necessary, because a long can store a byte.

        c. By using extra CPU processing power
        d. None of the above
Answer [=]
A
Explanation: 
Short Circuit operators are not 100% every time. Based on the value of the First operand, they decide whether to go evaluating the second expression

245. What happens to the Second operand/expression if the first operand is FALSE with a Short Circuit AND (&&) operator?
        a. Second operand/expression is evaluated and AND is applied.
        b. Evaluation of Second operand/expression is skipped.
        c. The compiler starts taking more memory
        d. The compiler starts taking more CPU power.
Answer [=]
B
Explanation: 
Whether it is normal AND operator or Short Circuit AND operator, both operands should be TRUE to give output as true. If the first operand itself is false, there is no point in evaluating the second expression.
246. What happens to the Second Operand/expression if the first operand is TRUE with a Short Circuit OR (||) operator in Java?
        a. Second expression/operand is evaluated and OR is applied to both operands

        c. The compiler starts taking more memory
        d. The compiler starts taking more CPU power
Answer [=]
B
Explanation: 
Both OR (|) and Short Circuit OR (||) operators give an output of true if at least one operand is true. Already the first operand is true. There is no need to evaluate or execute the second expression/operand.
247.  What is the output of an Exclusive OR (^) operation if one of the operands/expressions is TRUE?
        a. false
        b. true
        c. true or false
        d. None of the above
Answer [=]
C
Explanation: 
Exclusive OR (^) gives an output of true if both the operands are different. If both are the same (true / false), the output is false. So, with just one operand, you can not decide the output.
248. What is the output of an Exclusive OR(^) operation, if one of the operands is false?
        a. false
        b. true
        c. true or false
        d. None of the above
Answer [=]
C
Explanation: 
Exclusive OR (^) gives an output of true if both the operands are different. If both are the same (true / false), the output is false. So, with just one operand, you can not decide the output.

C
Explanation: 
Bitwise NOT(~) operator turns 1s to 0s
and 0s to 1s. If the leftmost bit is 1,
it is a negative number.
So take 1's complement and add 1 to it.
~0000 0101 =
 1111 1010
-----------
~ 111 1010 =
  000 0101
